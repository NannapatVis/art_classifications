# **ClassPic (Art Image Classification using CNN)**

**Dataset:**  
Art Images: Drawing/Painting/Sculptures/Engravings [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving) 

##### Detail:  
Dataset with about 9,000 images containing 5 types of arts:
1. Drawings and watercolours
2. Works of painting
3. Sculpture
4. Graphic Art
5. Iconography (old Russian art)

## Model Comparison

In this project, several models were used to evaluate and compare their performance on the test images. The models utilized include:

- **VGG16**
- **VGG19**
- **InceptionV3**
- **MobileNetV2**

Each model was tested to assess its effectiveness in classifying artistic representations, providing insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses in handling non-standard image data.

**All processes and methods can be found in the model [VGG16](https://github.com/NannapatVis/art_classifications/blob/main/Train_IMGVGG16.ipynb), [VGG19](https://github.com/NannapatVis/art_classifications/blob/main/Train_IMGVGG19.ipynb), [InceptionV3](https://github.com/NannapatVis/art_classifications/blob/main/InceptionV3-3.ipynb), and [MobileNetV2](https://github.com/NannapatVis/art_classifications/blob/main/Train_IMGMobileNetV2.ipynb).**
